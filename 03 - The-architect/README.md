# THE ARCHITECT

Simulates a software architecture expert

To start Streamlit version please execute

```shell
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Given that this experiment uses [Loop](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/) features of ADK, don't you expect a fast answer!!! 

The agent is forced to refine the solution multiple times, using also web resources, so you should expect several seconds to get a result, but it will be a very **deep thought** result.
